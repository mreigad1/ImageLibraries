B1 Part c
	Question:
	Compare the results of (a) and (b). For this particular case would you 
	suggest a block size of 8 or 16 for greater compression? Justify your 
	answer.

	Answer:
		The first 8 elements are nearly identical, this means that they may be very 
		effectively compressed together with very little frequency datum. The first 8
		elements vary significantly from the second 8 elements which are more alike to
		each other than the first sequence. This means that compressing each of the two
		lines separately will yield better compression volume and accuracy than
		compressing the entire 16 numbers together.
